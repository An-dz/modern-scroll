modern scroll přenese rolování na zcela novou úroveň
(Standardní rolovací posuvníky by měly být vypnuty pro předejítí zdvojení posuvníků. Proto jděte do Opera → Nastavení → Nastavení... (Ctrl+F12) → Pokročilé volby → Prohlížení a vypněte zde "Zobrazit posuvníky")

Co je úžasného na modern scroll?

+ boosts your scrolling performance!
+ scrolling speed is adjustable
+ its scroll bars don't take up any space so the whole screen width can be used to display what a browser is made for: websites
+ elements or whole pages don't shift by some pixels when content changes and bars become (un)necessary
+ scroll bars are usable in fullscreen mode as well
+ scroll bars automatically hide when they are not needed
+ unique "superbar" which makes it possible to scroll horizontally and vertically at the same time
+ optional buttons for scrolling to top and bottom of the page
+ behavior and appearance is fully customizable

This extension was originally planned as an update to "Slim ScrollBar" by damage92. But since it doesn't have a single line of code in common with the original extension we decided to publish it as a new one. Slim scrollbar will of course continue to exist if you prefer the other implementation or if you are using Opera below 12.10 where modern scroll isn't available. Due to damage92's rare spare time it's not being actively developed at the moment, though.
